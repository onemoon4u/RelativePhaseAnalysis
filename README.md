# RelativePhaseAnalysis
This repository provides core code for Relative Phase Analysis (RPA).

The materials here are produced by the "Brain States and Transitions Laboratory": https://moonbrainlab.org
All questions and inquiries are to be directed to the Principal Investigator, Dr. Joon-Young Moon.
Please refer to the above link for the contact address.

The codes are written in MATLAB, and this repository includes the necessary .m files and .mat files to perform RPA.
The RPA will be applied to a preprocessed, band-pass filtered multi-channel EEG/ECoG time series.
We will assume that the EEG/ECoG time series under investigation is already preprocessed.

The main script to run is "run_RPA.m"
The names of the directories and files in "run_RPA.m" must be modified accordingly to the user's environment.

The order of analysis included in the "run_RPA.m" is as follows:
